# Deathmatch Dreams

A DM-centric doom mod that feels a little liminal.

## Weapons

1. Mighty Boot Karate: Does 25-200 damage per hit and also pushes the target upwards on hit. Juggle your enemies!
2. Chainsaw Gauntlet: Launches you forward and does massive damage on hit, but comes with a lengthy cooldown.
3. Machine Pistol: Rapid-firing reasonably-accurate pistol. It's like a pocket chaingun! 5-10 damage per shot, 7 shots per second, should average out to around 50 DPS.
4. Hellfire Slugger: Fires highly-accurate hellish blasts for 20-40 damage per shot, once per second. The blast spreads out around the point of impact, firing two sub-shots to either side of the impact spot for 10-20 damage. Should average to 60 DPS, beating the pistol (but not by much).
5. Chaingun: An upgrade from the pistol! Fires every 3 frames for 8-12 damage per shot, coming out to around 120 DPS if you hit everything--but it has more spread than the pistol.
6. SSG: Holy cow, this thing shoots explosions! Fires a blast of flaming goodness that does 240 damage in a 128 unit radius right in front of you. Watch your spacing! Takes about 42 frames to reload.
7. Howitzer: Fires an extremely fast rocket that does more impact damage than the vanilla rocket, at the cost of going down to 80 splash damage. The Direct Hit called...
8. Plasma Thrower: The plasma charges move slowly for the first ~128 units of flight, then dramatically increase both their speed and damage.
9. BFG: Most of the charging sequence is quiet. Instead of a ball and invisible tracers, it fires a spread of infinitely-tall green lightning columns, plus a super-powered central blast.
