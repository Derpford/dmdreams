# Deathmatch Dreams

A DM-centric doom mod that feels a little liminal.

## Weapons

1. Mighty Boot Karate: Does 25-200 damage per hit and also pushes the target upwards on hit. Juggle your enemies!
2. Chainsaw Gauntlet: Launches you forward and does massive damage on hit, but comes with a lengthy cooldown.
3. Machine Pistol: Rapid-firing reasonably-accurate pistol. It's like a pocket chaingun! 5-10 damage per shot, 7 shots per second, should average out to around 50 DPS.
4. Hellfire Slugger: Fires highly-accurate hellish blasts for 20-40 damage per shot, once per second. The blast spreads out around the point of impact, firing two sub-shots to either side of the impact spot for 10-20 damage. Should average to 60 DPS, beating the pistol (but not by much).
5. Chaingun: An upgrade from the pistol! Fires every 3 frames for 8-12 damage per shot, coming out to around 120 DPS if you hit everything--but it's got a slight delay before firing, and has more spread than the pistol. Slightly *less* spread than vanilla chaingun, though.
6. SSG: Holy cow, this thing shoots explosions! Fires a blast of flaming goodness that does 240 damage in a 128 unit radius right in front of you. Watch your spacing! Takes about 50 frames to reload, slightly less than vanilla.
7. Howitzer: Fires an extremely fast rocket that does more consistent impact damage than the vanilla rocket (100-200), at the cost of going down to 80 splash damage and firing slower. The Direct Hit called...
8. Plasma Thrower: The plasma charges move slowly for the first ~128 units of flight (dealing 12-24 damage if they hit), then dramatically increase their speed and split into 2 (each dealing 12-18 on hit for 24-36 total). Still fires every 3 frames, coming out to around 210-315 DPS at "true" range or 105-210 DPS at point blank.
9. BFG: Most of the charging sequence is quiet. Instead of a ball and invisible tracers, it fires a spread of infinitely-tall green lightning columns, plus a super-powered central blast.
